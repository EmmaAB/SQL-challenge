## SQL-challenge
Emma Braden | SQL Homework | Due 8/12

This project looks at the employee records in SQL. Schemata.sql creates tables, where csv files from the data file can be imported. The tables are written to be created in the order that they must be dropped, created, and imported in order to work. 

A summary of the relationships is visualized in an ERD using QuickDBD contained in the ERD folder. 

Then, Queries.sql examines the data contained in the files further. 

It is clear that the data is only a joke because running a query on my employee ID number in Queries.sql reveals a woman named April Foolsday.
